oogle first unveiled Digital Wellbeing at Google I/O 2018 with a handful of tools to help users reduce their smartphone usage, but the company has steadily improved upon the app in the last 2 years by introducing loads of new features. In the latest beta update to version 1.0.312292882, Google is preparing to introduce major new features to help you get a better night’s sleep.

###### New “Daily Device Usage” toggle in “Manage Your Data”

The first feature that Google is introducing is already available for everyone on the latest beta release. If you open the settings menu in Digital Wellbeing, you’ll see a new “Manage your data” option that brings you to a new activity with a toggle for “daily device usage.” This option will let you decide if Digital Wellbeing should track your device unlocks, notifications received, and app usage. Disabling this option turns off usage access, so Digital Wellbeing can’t track your phone use anymore.

Currently, this toggle is the only one available in “Manage your data.” However, it will soon be joined by other options. Currently, this toggle is the only one available in “Manage your data.” However, it will soon be joined by other options.

#### Sleep Habit Tracking

The biggest new feature in the works is sleep habit tracking. We managed to surface a new activity that lets the user grant Digital Wellbeing and the Google Clock apps access to daily app usage, motion and light sensor data during your scheduled bedtimes, and time zone history. Granting these two apps access to that data will let both apps “show you a snapshot of your sleep habits.”

The strings from within the APK tell us what kind of insights Digital Wellbeing will be able to offer on sleep. In summary, Digital Wellbeing can tell you how long you spent in bed, how long you were on your phone while in bed (and how long you spent without it), and when your bedtime started and ended.
