We’ve had some time delving deep into the Android Q or Android 10 betas over the past few months. Now that the full release is here we’re going to dive even deeper and share every new feature and change we’ve found in Android 10 — arguably the biggest ever release of the world’s most popular mobile OS.

While more than just cosmetic changes abound in Android 10, we’ll just be focusing on the end-user facing updates. Of course, these include the design, interface, and operation of the biggest Android overhaul in some time.

As mentioned, we’ve covered many of the new features that have been slowly introduced and refined over the Android 10 — formerly Android Q Beta program. If you’ve already been updating your device since the very first beta, then there likely won’t be any surprises right out of the gate but there may be some tweaks and enhancements you simply weren’t aware of.
