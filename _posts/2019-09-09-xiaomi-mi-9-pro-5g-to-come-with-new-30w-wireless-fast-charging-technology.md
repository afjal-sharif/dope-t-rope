The Xiaomi Mi 9S 5G, as it was then presumed to be called on the basis of a teaser from China Unicom, was recently spotted on TENAA. Unfortunately, TENAA listings do not reveal a whole lot about the charging capabilities of the device, or even the official name of the phone for that matter. At an event in China, Xiaomi has launched its new Mi Charge Turbo 30W fast wireless charging solution, which will make its debut on the upcoming Xiaomi Mi 9 Pro 5G, the same phone that was spotted on TENAA.

The highlight of this event was Xiaomi’s Mi Charge Turbo technology, of course. Xiaomi claims that Mi Charge Turbo is the world’s first 30W wireless charging solution. With this, users can wirelessly charge a 4,000mAh battery phone from 0% to 50% in just 25 minutes, and up to 100% in just 70 minutes. This pitches the wireless charging solution to be higher than a lot of current generation wired charging solutions. The specifics of the working of this technology are not very clear at this stage since the presentation and source are in Chinese.

Mi Charge Turbo within Xiaomi smartphones will even have a 10W reverse wireless charging solution, which is in line with what we had found back in July 2019 when we reported that Xiaomi is working on a reverse wireless charging solution for its smartphones.

The first smartphone with Mi Charge Turbo will be the upcoming Xiaomi Mi 9 Pro 5G. But Xiaomi is not stopping here, as the company has already begun testing 40W wireless charging, alongside testing its insane 100W wired fast charging solution.

Xiaomi also used the event as an opportunity to announce two new wireless chargers. The first is a 30W Mi Charge Turbo based charger that is also Qi-compatible. This charger holds your phone in a vertical and upright position and also features an active cooling fan to ensure heat dissipation. The other charger is a larger 20W charger which frees up the user from the hassle of aligning their phone perfectly. The charger can detect where the phone is placed, and the charging coil system ensures that the phone receives full charge wherever it is placed.
