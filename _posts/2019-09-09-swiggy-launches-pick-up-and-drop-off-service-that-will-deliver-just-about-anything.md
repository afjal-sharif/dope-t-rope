When it comes to ordering food online, Swiggy is at the top of its game. The online food delivery app has even begun delivering grocery and perishables from local stores earlier this year. But Swiggy has more ambitious plans and it wants to do more than just deliver that pizza to your doorstep.

On Wednesday, Swiggy announced a new hyperlocal service ‘Swiggy Go’ that is dedicated to last-mile delivery for just about everything. The company said that the delivery fleet of Swiggy will help pick up and drop off items ranging from forgotten keys to laundry, lunch boxes and documents, etc. via the Swiggy app.

Besides Swiggy Go, the 2014 app-based start-up had previously relayed plans to start on-demand delivery service ‘Swiggy Stores’ in Hyderabad and Bengaluru, designed for doorstep delivery of medicines, flowers, and several other things in just an hour. Swiggy CEO Sriharsha Majety said, "The company's vision is to elevate the quality of life of urban consumers by offering unparalleled convenience,” Business Today reports.

Swiggy’s biggest rival in the new service fleet is Google-backed Dunzo app, an on-demand delivery service available 24/7 in Mumbai, Pune, Gurgaon, Delhi, Noida and Delhi. The online food delivery company is rolling out Swiggy Go by 2020, starting out with Bengaluru and later expanding the service across 300 cities in India.

Swiggy was founded in 2014 by Sriharsha Majety, Nandan Reddy and Rahul Jaimini. The food-delivery start-up connects consumers to over 1,30,000 restaurant partners across more than 325 cities.
