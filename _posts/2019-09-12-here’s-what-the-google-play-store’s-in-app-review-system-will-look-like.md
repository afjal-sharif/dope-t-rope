Back in July, XDA-Developers discovered that the Google Play Store could soon be providing a way for app developers to get reviews from their users without ever needing to leave the app. Today, we’ve uncovered a demo showing exactly how this in-app review process will work for Play Store apps.

About APK Insight: In this ‘APK Insight’ post, we’ve decompiled the latest version of an application that Google uploaded to the Play Store. When we decompile these files (called APKs, in the case of Android apps), we’re able to see various lines of code within that hint at possible future features. Keep in mind that Google may or may not ever ship these features, and our interpretation of what they are may be imperfect. We’ll try to enable those that are closer to being finished, however, to show you how they’ll look in the case that they do ship. With that in mind, read on.

It feels like almost every app these days asks you to kindly review it on the Play Store, to help boost the app’s ratings. To actually submit a review though, you’ve always had to leave the app and write your review directly on the Play Store listing, which was just frustrating enough to stop some from leaving helpful reviews.

Now, Google is testing a way to make reviewing Play Store apps easier than ever, with an in-app review flow. Following the most recent update to the Google Play Store, our Dylan Roussel discovered an internal app that Google is using to test in-app reviews. With some effort, he was able to use it to give a visual demonstration of how in-app reviews will work.
