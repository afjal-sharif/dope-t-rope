Nobody likes to wear helmets! Unless, you’re a bike-enthusiast who takes pride flaunting his riding essentials, helmets are a pain. They’re heavy and suffocating even though they save lives. Besides, the new traffic rules have got people fussing about having to wear a helmet on sunny days. That’s another level of discomfort altogether. But, a man has now devised a very ingenious hack to solve all your riding woes!

Sandeep Dahiya, director at a multinational company, has developed a prototype model of an air-conditioned helmet that can keep you cool while riding under the scorching sun. Passionate about designing user-friendly products, the Bengaluru native worked on his invention at his residence’s garage-turned workshop.

Sandeep first came up with the idea four and a half years ago when he caught a sight of two riders taking off their helmets after pulling up at a traffic signal. Ever since, he has designed eight different models of what he proudly calls, ‘Vatanukul’. The finished version of Vatanukul is powered by the bike battery and runs on 2 Volts of DC current. The best part about his exclusive helmet is that it does not require any external energy source and can be plugged in directly to the battery of the bike.

Most helmets that we find in the market today weigh in the range of 800 grams to 2 kilograms. Sandeep’s Vatanukul is not more than 1.7 kilograms heavy and is composed of two parts - the first unit has several rubber tubes meant for air circulation inside the helmet, while the other, is a wearable component, just like a backpack. It has a reverse thermo couple, heat exchanger, control and blower unit.

The heat exchanging blows cool air with the help of a semiconductor (commonly used in spaceships) that functions as a thermostat as the temperature rises and drops. The air circulator tubes are connected to a handy, remote controlled AC device.

Sandeep has been sampling the helmet while riding from his residence in RT Nagar to his office in UB City for a month now. The innovator told Times of India, “Many ask me what is it that I carry on my back, and they are surprised when I tell them it’s an air-cooler helmet.” Although it’s a bit on the heavier side, it would be so cool to have such a helmet available in the market.
