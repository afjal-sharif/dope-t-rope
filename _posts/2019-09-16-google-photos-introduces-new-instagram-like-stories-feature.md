Google is rolling out new features to its Photos app today, including the ability to order same-day prints (not available in India) and a new photo slideshow feature in Instagram Stories style called Memories.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Now, itâ€™s easier than ever to relive your best moments. <br><br>Rolling out today, you can take a stroll down memory lane right from Google Photos with our new Memories feature.

Starting today, every time you hop into the Google Photos app starting today, you may find that your Gallery has a new Instagram-like scrollable header called "Memories". Google in a blog post, quite unapologetically describes this feature as the stories format you've seen on social media, but 'Memories' will only use the pictures and videos you've uploaded to your account and meant only for you to see. You can of course, always choose to share memories with your contacts within Google Photos.

Like on Instagram, you can simply tap an icon to start looking through a collection and swipe or tap to progress through. Each Stories collection is only available for a short time and new ones will cycle through occasionally. If you don't want to see certain people or pets in your Memories or clips from a certain period of time, you can adjust those parameters in a new Memories section of the Google Photos app's settings.

Google is trying to offer features that make the app a messaging platform as well by letting people share pictures privately in a chat thread - a feature Google likes to call 'Direct Sharing'.

The new feature is rolling out on both Android and iOS starting today and you should be able to see on your phone very soon.

In the US, Google's also announced Canvas Prints - a feature that works on top of its Photo Prints feature to let you pick a photo and place it on an actual canvas ranging from 8x8, 11x14 and 16x20-inch sizes. You can choose to have the image stretch beyond the borders or even add black and white sides. These canvases will then be shipped straight to you doorstep in a matter of days.
